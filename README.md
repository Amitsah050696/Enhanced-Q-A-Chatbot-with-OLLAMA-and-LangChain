# Enhanced-Q-A-Chatbot-with-OLLAMA-and-LangChain
This project implements a Q&amp;A chatbot using LangChain, OLLAMA, and Streamlit. The chatbot allows users to ask questions and receive answers powered by a large language model (LLM). The backend LLM is provided by OLLAMA, and LangChain is used for prompt management and response parsing.
